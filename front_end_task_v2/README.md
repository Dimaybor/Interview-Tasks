2. Use your personal GitHub account to fork this project and push your solution to it (current branch and subdirectory).
3. Send link to your fork project with solution.
4. All solutions should be in the same forked project with good code style, comments and SOLUTION.md description.



## The priorities for solutions are:
  1) being correct
  2) being readable and extensible



### Challenge description

#### Project brief
Your goal is to pivot Github data in a way that users are in the center of it. To narrow our scope lets focus for
the purpose of this exercise on Scalhive repository https://github.com/Scalhive. You can find there many repositories
and each of them has it’s own contributors. Your goal is to create an app that will list Scalhive repositories and
some other  details
The app will contain three distinct views:
- List of Scalhive repositories
- The repository details page where we can find list of contributors. The list should be sorted by amount of
contributions
- The contributor details page

Judging criteria (top the most important)
- finished​​ working​​ sample
- creating a usable​ product (UX)
- code​​quality
- fluentness, responsiveness & performance

The sample project should be stored on your personal Github repository and share in response to email with challenge.


## Coding Standards
When working on the project use consistent coding style. Try to follow what's already defined in Chisel (EditorConfig,
stylelint, ESLint). You can also check guidelines like [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co/) or
[CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/).

## Project Deadline
Take your time but try to deliver it within 2 weeks time. If we don't see any activity in your test repository after
2 weeks (at least initial commits), we will automatically withdraw your application.

## Quality Assurance
