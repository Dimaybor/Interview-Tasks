### Challenge description

#### Project brief
Your goal is to pivot Github data in a way that users are in the center of it. To narrow our scope lets focus for
the purpose of this exercise on ScalHive repository https://github.com/Scalhive. You can find there many repositories
and each of them has it’s own contributors. Your goal is to create an app that will list ScalHive repositories and
some other  details
The app will contain three distinct views:
- List of Scalhive repositories
- The repository details page where we can find list of contributors. The list should be sorted by amount of
contributions
- The contributor details page

Judging criteria (top the most important)
- finished​​ working​​ sample
- creating a usable​ product (UX)
- code​​ quality
- fluentness, responsiveness & performance

The sample project should be stored on your personal private GitLab repository and share it's with team@scalhive.com
via email with us.
